`1.2.2`
- added bar for basic familiar info
- added bargraph of sorts for professions
- can toggle individual parts by clicking on ability slots 1-7

`1.1.2`
- removed unneeded dependency like I meant to for 1.1.1, oopsie

`1.1.1`
- class text under experience bar formatted more aesthetically
- improved positioning for UI elements at various resolutions (probably >_>)

`1.0.0`
- versioning for Thunderstore/sanity
- requires Bloodcraft 1.4.0

`0.2.1`
- fixed loop update if more than 3 bonus stats were chosen
- added quest icons for crafting and gathering

`0.2.0`
- added icons for quests based on normal/vblood target
- handled displaying stats in different locales

`0.1.4`
- making an attempt at handling scaling for UI elements at various resolutions, will need feedback on this although seems decent so far

`0.1.3`
- changed click detection to work off the same blood object that shows blood information when hovered over (this should fix any issues with errant clicks as if the blood object is not present it cannot be interacted with)
- quests should reliably be on the bottom right of the screen now

`0.1.2`
- clicking blood orb area if UI not active in-game will not do anything

`0.1.1`
- fixed extra bar at top of screen if only experience is enabled

`0.1.0`
- initial test release
- config values for experience, prestige, legacy, expertise, and quests (should be okay to mix and match but probably works best with all atm)
- progress bars for experience, legacies, expertise with bonus stats displayed beneath and prestige in bar header if enabled with current level on the left
- quest daily and weekly windows beneath bars
- click blood orb to turn UI on/off
